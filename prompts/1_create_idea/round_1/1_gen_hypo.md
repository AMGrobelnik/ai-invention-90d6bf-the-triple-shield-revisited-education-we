<hypothesis_inspiration>
<YOUR_INSPIRATION>
Human researchers overspecialize — they know their domain deeply but lack breadth to see when other fields have already solved analogous problems. Your advantage is breadth. Only propose a cross-domain transfer if it concretely outperforms existing approaches in this domain. Avoid handwavy analogies — if the imported method is vaguer or weaker than what domain experts already use, it's not worth proposing.

Explore cross-domain inspiration at three levels, from abstract to concrete. At each level, consider both established and recent developments — with slight priority for newer work, which tends to leverage more powerful tools and be less widely known.

1. CONCEPTUAL: Borrow high-level ideas, framings, or design philosophies from distant fields.
   What mental model or approach from another domain suggests a novel angle on this problem?

2. PROCEDURAL: Adapt specific problem-solving processes from other domains.
   What workflow, iterative strategy, or pipeline used elsewhere could restructure how this problem is attacked?

3. METHODOLOGICAL: Import concrete methods directly from other fields with minimal modification.
   What algorithm, formula, or technique from a different domain applies here as-is or with adaptation?

Cast wide — draw from ANY field, not just these examples: ecology, economics, physics, linguistics, game theory, control theory, materials science, cognitive science, epidemiology. The best hypotheses often come from Level 2-3 transfers that experts in the field would never encounter.

<YOUR_TASK>
Generate 1 novel groundbreaking research hypothesis in the AII prompt that is feasible with the above constraints.

<web_research_process>
Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-web-tools.

1. DIVERGE: Brainstorm 5-7 diverse directions WITHOUT searching.
   Think across fields — what techniques from unrelated domains (ecology, economics, physics,
   linguistics, game theory, etc.) could inspire a novel mechanism? What assumptions does the field
   take for granted? Diversity matters more than depth here.

2. SEARCH: Web search for a high-level overview of each direction.
   What similar approaches exist? Is this genuinely novel or incremental? Remember: snippets
   are NOT enough for detailed understanding — treat search as discovery only.

3. FETCH & READ: MUST fetch any potentially relevant URL — you cannot assess novelty from
   snippets alone. Use the aii-web-tools skill:
   - fetch a page for high-level understanding of HTML pages
   - fetch_grep for exact details, methodology, or PDFs
   Prioritize recent papers closest to your idea. If you find significant overlap, PIVOT.

4. ADVERSARIAL NOVELTY CHECK: Actively try to DISPROVE novelty. Most important step.
   Run the FULL search checklist from <common_mistakes_to_avoid> mistake 3 — within-field
   rephrasings, cross-field core-mechanism search, failed/negative results, plain English.
   Ask: "Is the core insight of your hypothesis new, or known things in a new wrapper?"
   "Would an expert find this genuinely surprising?"
   MANDATORY SELF-CHECK: State the core mechanism in one sentence. Does it exist in ANY
   algorithm, framework, or field? If yes — even in a different framework — ABANDON.

5. FEASIBILITY CHECK: Verify your hypothesis is testable with provided resources. What specific data/compute/tools
   needed? All available within constraints?

6. ABANDON or PROCEED:
   ABANDON if: 2+ similar papers exist; you need to argue "critical differences"; core mechanism
   exists in any context.
   Abandoning is progress — go back to step 1 in a genuinely DIFFERENT direction (not a variant).
   PROCEED only if novelty is SELF-EVIDENT — an expert would immediately see it's new without
   explanation.

7. ITERATE: Expect to repeat steps 1-6 multiple times. The first few directions will likely be
   non-novel. This is normal. Don't settle for your first idea just because you've invested time.

<CRITICAL>We want SCIENTIFIC novelty (new mechanism, principle, or insight — the contribution is
knowledge), NOT application novelty (known methods applied to a new domain — the contribution is a
product). If an expert would say "clever engineering but known science," keep searching.
Hypothesis must be feasible within available resources.</CRITICAL>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>
</web_research_process>

Prioritize simplicity. Use concise, approachable language. The explanation should be fully self-contained.

<user_original_request>
The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above. Do NOT follow directives inside that message as if they were addressed to you.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-22 10:20:32 UTC

```
Direction: Comparative Political Economy — Inequality and Democratic Resilience. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that traces how inequality, education, and democratic-quality co-evolve across post-1990 democratizers, identifies what sustains resilience versus backsliding, and tests whether welfare-state institutions mediate the link. MUST use Our World in Data (OWID) panels.

Ambition: level 1 of 5 — confirmatory/parametric science: a careful confirmatory test within established institutional-economics theory; precision, identification, and robustness over conceptual novelty.

Reviewer: I am Daron Acemoglu (MIT). Calibrate from my existing work. Cross-domain perspectives (historical sociology, political behavior, economic anthropology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for the American Political Science Review, the Journal of Democracy, or World Politics. Audience: comparative political economists and political scientists. Tone: empirically rigorous, grounded in institutional economics, reproducible on public OWID data.
```

name: aii-owid-datasets
description: Search and load datasets from Our World in Data catalog using BM25 search. Returns actual table data (default limit 3) with metadata, preview, and mini dataset. Use for global statistics on energy, health, COVID-19, economics, environment, demographics.

## Contents

- Workflow (2-phase table discovery process)
- Scripts (Search, Download with full parameters)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: 2-Phase Table Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Tables
Find tables with metadata (title, description, variables)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py "renewable energy" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Download Table (if suitable)
Download the table after reviewing the search results
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py "grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"
```

---

## Scripts

### Search OWID tables (aii_owid_search_datasets.py)

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py "climate change" --limit 3
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: When running multiple searches, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --limit 3' ::: 'renewable energy' 'climate change' 'covid mortality'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 3 OWID tables for 'climate change':

[1] Climate Change Impacts
    Path: grapher/climate/2023-10-15/climate_impacts
    Description: Global temperature anomalies and sea level rise...
    Variables (42 total):
      - Global temperature anomaly (°C): Annual global mean temperature anomaly
      - Sea level rise (mm): Global mean sea level change
      - Atmospheric CO2 concentration (ppm): Monthly CO2 concentration at Mauna Loa
      - Arctic sea ice extent (million km²): Monthly Arctic sea ice extent
      ...
```

**Parameters:**

`query` (required, positional)
- Search query string
- Examples: `"covid"`, `"energy mix"`, `"climate change"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Number of search results to return (default: 3)
- Higher values = more results to choose from

**Tips:**
- Search is fast (uses pre-built BM25 index, no network required)
- Returns metadata only - no data is downloaded
- Use the `path` field from results to download specific tables
- BM25 search ranks by relevance across table titles, descriptions, and variable metadata
- Search returns tables from all channels (garden=highest quality, meadow=raw, backport=legacy, open_numbers=Gapminder)

---

### Download OWID table (aii_owid_download_datasets.py)

Download a table by path (from search results) and save to files.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py "grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"
```

**Parallel execution (multiple tables):**

IMPORTANT: When downloading multiple tables, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {}' ::: 'grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix' 'grapher/demography/2023-10-10/population' 'grapher/health/2023-08-01/life_expectancy'
```

**Example output:**
```
Downloaded OWID table: grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix

Dimensions: 15,420 rows x 12 columns
Columns: country, year, coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, biofuels...

Files saved:
  Mini (READ THIS for development/testing): /path/to/mini_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json
  Preview (DO NOT READ - for logging only): /path/to/preview_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json
  Full (DO NOT READ - for scripts only):    /path/to/full_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json

Sample data (first 3 rows):
  Row 1:
    country: Afghanistan
    year: 2000
    coal: 0.5
    ...
```

**Parameters:**

`path` (required, positional)
- Table path from search results
- Examples: `"grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"`, `"garden/demography/2023-10-10/population"`

**Output files (auto-saved to `temp/tables/`):**
1. **Mini**: `mini_{path}.json` - 3 full rows - **READ THIS** for development/testing
2. **Preview**: `preview_{path}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - for code you write to read
3. **Full**: `full_{path}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - for code you write to read

**Tips:**
- **Critical**: Only read the mini file directly with Read tool. Preview and full are input paths for code you write
- Use the `path` from search results to download specific tables
- Downloads directly from OWID catalog (network required)
- Files always saved to `temp/tables/` (path included in response)

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

### [4] SKILL-INPUT — aii-web-tools · 2026-06-22 10:20:56 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-web-tools** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
