<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: >-
  The Triple Shield: How Education and Welfare State Institutions Jointly Buffer the Inequality-Democratic Backsliding Link
  in Post-1990 Democratizers
hypothesis: >-
  In post-1990 democratizers, the negative effect of income inequality on democratic quality (measured by V-Dem electoral
  democracy index) is conditioned by a two-level protective mechanism: (1) higher education levels weaken the inequality-democratic
  erosion link by increasing citizens' de facto political capacity to resist elite capture, and (2) generous welfare state
  spending further buffers this relationship by providing de jure institutional constraints on executive predation. Specifically,
  we hypothesize a triple interaction where the inequality-democracy relationship becomes non-significant when both education
  levels AND welfare state spending are above median, but remains strongly negative when either or both are below median.
motivation: >-
  Despite extensive research on inequality and democratic backsliding (Acemoglu & Robinson 2006, Carothers & Hartnett 2024),
  existing work treats education and welfare states as separate protective factors. This hypothesis matters because: (1) it
  provides a nuanced, interaction-based account of democratic resilience that matches Acemoglu's de jure/de facto power framework;
  (2) it has direct policy implications—suggesting that democratizers need BOTH human capital development AND social protection
  to withstand inequality pressures; (3) it speaks to contemporary debates about why some post-1990 democratizers (e.g., Poland,
  Czechia) succeeded while others (e.g., Hungary, Turkey) backslid; (4) using OWID panels ensures reproducibility and accessibility
  of findings.
assumptions:
- >-
  V-Dem electoral democracy index adequately captures democratic quality in post-1990 democratizers
- >-
  Gini coefficient adequately measures income inequality relevant to political behavior
- >-
  Mean years of schooling captures the relevant dimension of education for political capacity
- Social protection spending as % of GDP captures welfare state generosity
- >-
  The sample of post-1990 democratizers can be meaningfully analyzed as a group despite regional differences
investigation_approach: >-
  Use Our World in Data (OWID) panel data (1990-2022) for all countries that transitioned to electoral democracy 1990-1999
  and remained sovereign through 2022. Main variables: (1) Outcome: V-Dem Electoral Democracy Index (variable 1209753); (2)
  Inequality: Gini coefficient (variable 1014857); (3) Education: Mean years of schooling (variable 809139); (4) Welfare:
  Social protection spending % GDP (variable 1210307). Estimation: Fixed-effects panel regression with triple interaction
  (inequality × education × welfare), controlling for GDP per capita, natural resource rents, ethnic fractionalization, and
  regional dummies. Test robustness with: (a) alternative inequality measures (P90/P10 ratio if available); (b) liberal democracy
  index as outcome; (c) lagged dependent variable models; (d) propensity-score matching to address selection into high-education/high-welfare
  combinations.
success_criteria: >-
  Hypothesis confirmed if: (1) Triple interaction term is statistically significant (p < 0.05) and positive (indicating buffering);
  (2) Simple effect of inequality on democracy is negative and significant when education AND welfare are low, but non-significant
  when both are high; (3) Results hold with alternative specifications and robustness checks. Hypothesis disconfirmed if:
  (1) Triple interaction is non-significant; (2) Only single interactions (inequality×education OR inequality×welfare) are
  significant but not the triple; (3) Effect disappears with basic controls.
related_works:
- >-
  Carothers & Hartnett (2024) 'Misunderstanding Democratic Backsliding' (Journal of Democracy): Argues backsliding is driven
  by predatory leaders, not economic delivery failures. Our hypothesis DIFFERS by focusing on institutional conditions (education
  + welfare) that enable resistance to such leaders, not denying their importance.
- >-
  Acemoglu & Robinson (2006) 'De Facto Political Power and Institutional Persistence' (American Economic Review): Develops
  de facto vs de jure power framework. Our hypothesis DIFFERS by empirically testing how education (de facto power) and welfare
  institutions (de jure constraints) interact to protect democracy under high inequality.
- >-
  PNAS 2024 'Income inequality and the erosion of democracy in the twenty-first century': Finds robust inequality-backsliding
  link. Our hypothesis DIFFERS by identifying conditional factors (education, welfare) that moderate this relationship, moving
  beyond simple main effects.
- >-
  Orenstein (2008) 'Poverty, Inequality, and Democracy: Postcommunist Welfare States' (Journal of Democracy): Examines welfare
  spending in post-communist countries. Our hypothesis DIFFERS by (a) including education as co-mediator, (b) testing triple
  interaction explicitly, (c) covering all post-1990 democratizers globally, not just post-communist cases.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis synthesizes three insights from Acemoglu's framework: (1) De facto political power (education increases citizens'
  capacity to organize and resist elite predation); (2) De jure political power (welfare state institutions constrain executive
  authority and provide formal channels for interest representation); (3) Strategic interaction between elites and masses
  under uncertainty about future political power. The triple interaction design was inspired by recent work in political economy
  on 'interlocking institutional protections' (e.g., how multiple inclusive institutions reinforce each other). The focus
  on post-1990 democratizers responds to Carothers & Hartnett's (2024) call for nuanced, context-specific analysis of backsliding
  rather than sweeping 'inequality causes backsliding' claims.
terms:
- term: De facto political power
  definition: >-
    Actual influence over political outcomes that citizens wield through collective action, protests, and informal political
    pressure, as opposed to formal legal rights (de jure power). Education increases de facto power by enhancing citizens'
    ability to coordinate and demand accountability.
- term: De jure political power
  definition: >-
    Political influence derived from formal legal and institutional arrangements, such as voting rights, legislative constraints
    on executive power, and constitutional protections. Welfare state institutions provide de jure power by creating formal
    channels for interest representation and resource redistribution.
- term: Democratic backsliding
  definition: >-
    The process by which elected leaders gradually undermine democratic institutions (free elections, civil liberties, checks
    and balances) without formally abandoning democratic institutions, typically through executive aggrandizement and norm
    erosion.
- term: Post-1990 democratizers
  definition: >-
    Countries that transitioned from authoritarian rule to electoral democracy during the 'Third Wave' peak (1990-1999), including
    post-communist states, Latin American cases completing transitions, and sub-Saharan African democratizers in the 1990s.
- term: Triple interaction
  definition: >-
    A statistical specification where the effect of one variable (inequality) on an outcome (democratic quality) depends simultaneously
    on two moderating variables (education and welfare spending), allowing testing of whether BOTH conditions must be present
    to provide protection.
- term: V-Dem Electoral Democracy Index
  definition: >-
    A continuous index (0-1) produced by Varieties of Democracy project, measuring the extent to which political leaders are
    elected under comprehensive suffrage in free and fair elections with freedom of expression and association.
summary: >-
  In post-1990 democratizers, high inequality threatens democratic quality only when citizens lack both education (de facto
  power) and welfare state protection (de jure constraints); when both are present, the inequality-democracy link is buffered.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: dataset_iter1_dir1
type: dataset
objective: >-
  Collect complete OWID panel data (1990-2022) for all variables required to test the triple shield hypothesis in post-1990
  democratizers.
approach: >-
  Use aii-owid-datasets skill to search and download the following variables: (1) V-Dem Electoral Democracy Index (variable
  1209753), (2) Gini coefficient (variable 1014857), (3) Mean years of schooling (variable 809139), (4) Social protection
  spending % GDP (variable 1210307). Also collect control variables: GDP per capita, natural resource rents, and population.
  Identify post-1990 democratizers using Freedom House or Polity IV criteria (countries transitioning 1990-1999). Create analysis-ready
  panel dataset with proper country-year structure, handle missing values through multiple imputation or listwise deletion
  as appropriate, and export in JSON format with full/mini/preview variants.

</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for dataset artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-22 10:39:04 UTC

```
Direction: Comparative Political Economy — Inequality and Democratic Resilience. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that traces how inequality, education, and democratic-quality co-evolve across post-1990 democratizers, identifies what sustains resilience versus backsliding, and tests whether welfare-state institutions mediate the link. MUST use Our World in Data (OWID) panels.

Ambition: level 1 of 5 — confirmatory/parametric science: a careful confirmatory test within established institutional-economics theory; precision, identification, and robustness over conceptual novelty.

Reviewer: I am Daron Acemoglu (MIT). Calibrate from my existing work. Cross-domain perspectives (historical sociology, political behavior, economic anthropology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for the American Political Science Review, the Journal of Democracy, or World Politics. Audience: comparative political economists and political scientists. Tone: empirically rigorous, grounded in institutional economics, reproducible on public OWID data.
```

## Contents

- Workflow (2-phase table discovery process)
- Scripts (Search, Download with full parameters)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: 2-Phase Table Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Tables
Find tables with metadata (title, description, variables)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py "renewable energy" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Download Table (if suitable)
Download the table after reviewing the search results
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py "grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"
```

---

## Scripts

### Search OWID tables (aii_owid_search_datasets.py)

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py "climate change" --limit 3
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: When running multiple searches, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --limit 3' ::: 'renewable energy' 'climate change' 'covid mortality'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 3 OWID tables for 'climate change':

[1] Climate Change Impacts
    Path: grapher/climate/2023-10-15/climate_impacts
    Description: Global temperature anomalies and sea level rise...
    Variables (42 total):
      - Global temperature anomaly (°C): Annual global mean temperature anomaly
      - Sea level rise (mm): Global mean sea level change
      - Atmospheric CO2 concentration (ppm): Monthly CO2 concentration at Mauna Loa
      - Arctic sea ice extent (million km²): Monthly Arctic sea ice extent
      ...
```

**Parameters:**

`query` (required, positional)
- Search query string
- Examples: `"covid"`, `"energy mix"`, `"climate change"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Number of search results to return (default: 3)
- Higher values = more results to choose from

**Tips:**
- Search is fast (uses pre-built BM25 index, no network required)
- Returns metadata only - no data is downloaded
- Use the `path` field from results to download specific tables
- BM25 search ranks by relevance across table titles, descriptions, and variable metadata
- Search returns tables from all channels (garden=highest quality, meadow=raw, backport=legacy, open_numbers=Gapminder)

---

### Download OWID table (aii_owid_download_datasets.py)

Download a table by path (from search results) and save to files.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py "grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"
```

**Parallel execution (multiple tables):**

IMPORTANT: When downloading multiple tables, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {}' ::: 'grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix' 'grapher/demography/2023-10-10/population' 'grapher/health/2023-08-01/life_expectancy'
```

**Example output:**
```
Downloaded OWID table: grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix

Dimensions: 15,420 rows x 12 columns
Columns: country, year, coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, biofuels...

Files saved:
  Mini (READ THIS for development/testing): /path/to/mini_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json
  Preview (DO NOT READ - for logging only): /path/to/preview_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json
  Full (DO NOT READ - for scripts only):    /path/to/full_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json

Sample data (first 3 rows):
  Row 1:
    country: Afghanistan
    year: 2000
    coal: 0.5
    ...
```

**Parameters:**

`path` (required, positional)
- Table path from search results
- Examples: `"grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"`, `"garden/demography/2023-10-10/population"`

**Output files (auto-saved to `temp/tables/`):**
1. **Mini**: `mini_{path}.json` - 3 full rows - **READ THIS** for development/testing
2. **Preview**: `preview_{path}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - for code you write to read
3. **Full**: `full_{path}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - for code you write to read

**Tips:**
- **Critical**: Only read the mini file directly with Read tool. Preview and full are input paths for code you write
- Use the `path` from search results to download specific tables
- Downloads directly from OWID catalog (network required)
- Files always saved to `temp/tables/` (path included in response)

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

The agent loaded the **aii-web-tools** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

---
name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Hypothesis Selection & Evaluation:**
- `sel_hypo_out.json` - Hypothesis Selection output (all hypotheses with selected flags)

- `novelty_eval_top.json` - Single best selected hypothesis

**Experiment Pipeline:**
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

title: >-
  The Triple Shield: How Education and Welfare State Institutions Jointly Buffer the Inequality-Democratic Backsliding Link
  in Post-1990 Democratizers
hypothesis: >-
  In post-1990 democratizers, the negative effect of income inequality on democratic quality (measured by V-Dem electoral
  democracy index) is conditioned by a two-level protective mechanism: (1) higher education levels weaken the inequality-democratic
  erosion link by increasing citizens' de facto political capacity to resist elite capture, and (2) generous welfare state
  spending further buffers this relationship by providing de jure institutional constraints on executive predation. Specifically,
  we hypothesize a triple interaction where the inequality-democracy relationship becomes non-significant when both education
  levels AND welfare state spending are above median, but remains strongly negative when either or both are below median.
motivation: >-
  Despite extensive research on inequality and democratic backsliding (Acemoglu & Robinson 2006, Carothers & Hartnett 2024),
  existing work treats education and welfare states as separate protective factors. This hypothesis matters because: (1) it
  provides a nuanced, interaction-based account of democratic resilience that matches Acemoglu's de jure/de facto power framework;
  (2) it has direct policy implications—suggesting that democratizers need BOTH human capital development AND social protection
  to withstand inequality pressures; (3) it speaks to contemporary debates about why some post-1990 democratizers (e.g., Poland,
  Czechia) succeeded while others (e.g., Hungary, Turkey) backslid; (4) using OWID panels ensures reproducibility and accessibility
  of findings.
assumptions:
- >-
  V-Dem electoral democracy index adequately captures democratic quality in post-1990 democratizers
- >-
  Gini coefficient adequately measures income inequality relevant to political behavior
- >-
  Mean years of schooling captures the relevant dimension of education for political capacity
- Social protection spending as % of GDP captures welfare state generosity
- >-
  The sample of post-1990 democratizers can be meaningfully analyzed as a group despite regional differences
investigation_approach: >-
  Use Our World in Data (OWID) panel data (1990-2022) for all countries that transitioned to electoral democracy 1990-1999
  and remained sovereign through 2022. Main variables: (1) Outcome: V-Dem Electoral Democracy Index (variable 1209753); (2)
  Inequality: Gini coefficient (variable 1014857); (3) Education: Mean years of schooling (variable 809139); (4) Welfare:
  Social protection spending % GDP (variable 1210307). Estimation: Fixed-effects panel regression with triple interaction
  (inequality × education × welfare), controlling for GDP per capita, natural resource rents, ethnic fractionalization, and
  regional dummies. Test robustness with: (a) alternative inequality measures (P90/P10 ratio if available); (b) liberal democracy
  index as outcome; (c) lagged dependent variable models; (d) propensity-score matching to address selection into high-education/high-welfare
  combinations.
success_criteria: >-
  Hypothesis confirmed if: (1) Triple interaction term is statistically significant (p < 0.05) and positive (indicating buffering);
  (2) Simple effect of inequality on democracy is negative and significant when education AND welfare are low, but non-significant
  when both are high; (3) Results hold with alternative specifications and robustness checks. Hypothesis disconfirmed if:
  (1) Triple interaction is non-significant; (2) Only single interactions (inequality×education OR inequality×welfare) are
  significant but not the triple; (3) Effect disappears with basic controls.

  Orenstein (2008) 'Poverty, Inequality, and Democracy: Postcommunist Welfare States' (Journal of Democracy): Examines welfare
  spending in post-communist countries. Our hypothesis DIFFERS by (a) including education as co-mediator, (b) testing triple
  interaction explicitly, (c) covering all post-1990 democratizers globally, not just post-communist cases.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis synthesizes three insights from Acemoglu's framework: (1) De facto political power (education increases citizens'
  capacity to organize and resist elite predation); (2) De jure political power (welfare state institutions constrain executive
  authority and provide formal channels for interest representation); (3) Strategic interaction between elites and masses
  under uncertainty about future political power. The triple interaction design was inspired by recent work in political economy
  on 'interlocking institutional protections' (e.g., how multiple inclusive institutions reinforce each other). The focus
  on post-1990 democratizers responds to Carothers & Hartnett's (2024) call for nuanced, context-specific analysis of backsliding
  rather than sweeping 'inequality causes backsliding' claims.
terms:
- term: De facto political power
  definition: >-
    Actual influence over political outcomes that citizens wield through collective action, protests, and informal political
    pressure, as opposed to formal legal rights (de jure power). Education increases de facto power by enhancing citizens'
    ability to coordinate and demand accountability.
- term: De jure political power
  definition: >-
    Political influence derived from formal legal and institutional arrangements, such as voting rights, legislative constraints
    on executive power, and constitutional protections. Welfare state institutions provide de jure power by creating formal
    channels for interest representation and resource redistribution.
- term: Democratic backsliding
  definition: >-
    The process by which elected leaders gradually undermine democratic institutions (free elections, civil liberties, checks
    and balances) without formally abandoning democratic institutions, typically through executive aggrandizement and norm
    erosion.
- term: Post-1990 democratizers
  definition: >-
    Countries that transitioned from authoritarian rule to electoral democracy during the 'Third Wave' peak (1990-1999), including
    post-communist states, Latin American cases completing transitions, and sub-Saharan African democratizers in the 1990s.
- term: Triple interaction
  definition: >-
    A statistical specification where the effect of one variable (inequality) on an outcome (democratic quality) depends simultaneously
    on two moderating variables (education and welfare spending), allowing testing of whether BOTH conditions must be present
    to provide protection.
- term: V-Dem Electoral Democracy Index
  definition: >-
    A continuous index (0-1) produced by Varieties of Democracy project, measuring the extent to which political leaders are
    elected under comprehensive suffrage in free and fair elections with freedom of expression and association.
summary: >-
  In post-1990 democratizers, high inequality threatens democratic quality only when citizens lack both education (de facto
  power) and welfare state protection (de jure constraints); when both are present, the inequality-democracy link is buffered.

objective: >-
  Collect complete OWID panel data (1990-2022) for all variables required to test the triple shield hypothesis in post-1990
  democratizers.
approach: >-
  Use aii-owid-datasets skill to search and download the following variables: (1) V-Dem Electoral Democracy Index (variable

  spending % GDP (variable 1210307). Also collect control variables: GDP per capita, natural resource rents, and population.
  Identify post-1990 democratizers using Freedom House or Polity IV criteria (countries transitioning 1990-1999). Create analysis-ready
  panel dataset with proper country-year structure, handle missing values through multiple imputation or listwise deletion
  as appropriate, and export in JSON format with full/mini/preview variants.
depends_on: []
</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for dataset artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

Direction: Comparative Political Economy — Inequality and Democratic Resilience. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that traces how inequality, education, and democratic-quality co-evolve across post-1990 democratizers, identifies what sustains resilience versus backsliding, and tests whether welfare-state institutions mediate the link. MUST use Our World in Data (OWID) panels.

Ambition: level 1 of 5 — confirmatory/parametric science: a careful confirmatory test within established institutional-economics theory; precision, identification, and robustness over conceptual novelty.

Reviewer: I am Daron Acemoglu (MIT). Calibrate from my existing work. Cross-domain perspectives (historical sociology, political behavior, economic anthropology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for the American Political Science Review, the Journal of Democracy, or World Politics. Audience: comparative political economists and political scientists. Tone: empirically rigorous, grounded in institutional economics, reproducible on public OWID data.
