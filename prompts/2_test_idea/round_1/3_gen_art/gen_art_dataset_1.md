Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_9gq-UFm593U6/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_9gq-UFm593U6/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1/`:

title: OWID Panel Data Collection for Triple Shield Hypothesis
summary: >-
  Collect complete OWID panel data (1990-2022) for all variables required to test the triple interaction hypothesis (inequality
  × education × welfare) on democratic backsliding in post-1990 democratizers.
runpod_compute_profile: gpu
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  Panel dataset with country-year observations for post-1990 democratizers (1990-2022). Variables: (1) Outcome: V-Dem Electoral
  Democracy Index (0-1); (2) Predictor: Gini coefficient; (3) Moderator 1: Mean years of schooling; (4) Moderator 2: Social
  protection spending % GDP; (5) Controls: GDP per capita, natural resource rents, population. Country-year format with ISO
  3-letter codes. Missing data <30%. Exportable as JSON with full/mini/preview variants.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  PHASE 1: IDENTIFY POST-1990 DEMOCRATIZERS

  Step 1.1: Search OWID for V-Dem transition data
  - Queries: 'V-Dem transition', 'regime transition 1990', 'Freedom House transition'
  - Use V-Dem v2x_polyarchy to identify transitions (crossed 0.5 threshold in 1990-1999)
  - Verify countries remained sovereign through 2022

  Step 1.2: Expected country list
  - Eastern Europe/CIS: POL, CZE, SVK, HUN, EST, LVA, LTU, SVN, HRV, ROU, BGR, ALB, MKD, SRB, MNE, BIH, UKR, BLR, MDA, RUS, ARM, GEO, AZE, KAZ, KGZ, UZB, TKM, TJK
  - Latin America: PER, GTM, PRY, HTI
  - Africa: BEN, BWA, CPV, GHA, MWI, MLI, NAM, STP, SEN, ZAF, ZMB, MDG, MOZ, TZA
  - Asia: MNG, PHL, THA, IDN

  PHASE 2: COLLECT OWID VARIABLES

  Step 2.1: V-Dem Electoral Democracy Index
  - Search: 'V-Dem electoral democracy', 'v2x_polyarchy'
  - Expected path: garden/v-dem/... or grapher/v-dem/...
  - Fallback: V-Dem website (www.v-dem.net/data)

  Step 2.2: Gini Coefficient
  - Search: 'Gini coefficient', 'income inequality'
  - Sources: World Bank, SWIID
  - Prefer: After-tax Gini

  Step 2.3: Mean Years of Schooling
  - Search: 'mean years of schooling', 'schooling'
  - Sources: UNESCO, Barro-Lee

  Step 2.4: Social Protection Spending
  - Search: 'social protection spending', 'social expenditure'
  - Sources: ILO, OECD
  - Note: Limited coverage in developing countries

  Step 2.5: Control Variables
  - GDP per capita (World Bank)
  - Natural resource rents (World Bank)
  - Population (UN)
  - Ethnic fractionalization (Alesina/Fearon, may need external source)

  PHASE 3: DATA MERGING AND CLEANING

  Step 3.1: Merge on country-year key (ISO 3-letter codes)
  Step 3.2: Filter to post-1990 democratizers
  Step 3.3: Handle missing data (<10%: interpolate; 10-30%: multiple imputation; >30%: document)
  Step 3.4: Create derived variables (median indicators, region dummies, z-scores)

  PHASE 4: EXPORT AND VALIDATION

  Step 4.1: Export full/mini/preview JSON
  Step 4.2: Validate (N countries, variable ranges, correlations, interaction feasibility)
  Step 4.3: Document sources (data_dictionary.json)

  FALLBACKS: If OWID fails use HuggingFace or direct download. If social protection sparse use health/education expenditure. If democratizer list uncertain use V-Dem v2x_transition.

  TIME: 6 hours total (Phase 1: 1h, Phase 2: 2.5h, Phase 3: 1.5h, Phase 4: 1h)
  PARALLELIZATION: All OWID searches and downloads can run in parallel.
target_num_datasets: 7

<available_data_sources>
Use the sources appropriate to your task. Read the relevant skill file BEFORE using each source.

- **HuggingFace Hub** (HF) — ML datasets (NLP, vision, tabular, benchmarks)
- **Our World in Data** (OWID) — Global statistics (energy, health, economics, environment, demographics)
- **Alternate methods** — Python/shell (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URL, APIs, etc.)

If the plan specifies a source or one fits better, use it.
You may combine sources. Use web search (aii-web-tools skill) to research candidates (background, papers, provenance) — NOT to find/download datasets.
</available_data_sources>

<available_domain_handbooks>
If your domain has a handbook, read the relevant skill file BEFORE working on that domain.

- **Multi-LLM Agents** — dataset selection, evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns
</available_domain_handbooks>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.
</repo_upload_exclusions>

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-python, aii-long-running-tasks, aii-json, aii-file-size-limit, aii-use-hardware, aii-parallel-computing.
TODO 2. Read skill files for your data sources (see <available_data_sources>) and domain handbook if applicable (see <available_domain_handbooks>). Based on plan and context, decide which source(s) to use. Include everything specified in the artifact plan, but you may also collect additional relevant data beyond what's listed. Run 50 diverse searches across chosen source(s) — BROAD, GENERAL terms, not very specific. Parallelize where supported.
TODO 3. Identify the 25 most promising datasets. IMPORTANT: Only consider datasets under 300MB. Preview/inspect sample rows for each candidate. Parallelize previews.
TODO 4. Research each candidate BEFORE choosing which to download. For each, search the web (aii-web-tools skill): dataset name, papers citing it, original source/task, popularity. Red flags: no search results, no papers, anonymized features (F1, F2...), <100 downloads, no documentation. Green flags: papers using it, clear documentation, meaningful features, established benchmark. Also consider: will features/structure allow meaningful evaluation of the planned method?
TODO 5. Decide which to KEEP vs DISCARD. Look for: clear structure, relevant fields, quality examples matching requirements, confirmed provenance. Determine which 14 datasets have the most suitable data. Download and save to `temp/datasets/`. Parallelize downloads.
</todos>

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-22 11:01:17 UTC

```
Direction: Comparative Political Economy — Inequality and Democratic Resilience. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that traces how inequality, education, and democratic-quality co-evolve across post-1990 democratizers, identifies what sustains resilience versus backsliding, and tests whether welfare-state institutions mediate the link. MUST use Our World in Data (OWID) panels.

Ambition: level 1 of 5 — confirmatory/parametric science: a careful confirmatory test within established institutional-economics theory; precision, identification, and robustness over conceptual novelty.

Reviewer: I am Daron Acemoglu (MIT). Calibrate from my existing work. Cross-domain perspectives (historical sociology, political behavior, economic anthropology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for the American Political Science Review, the Journal of Democracy, or World Politics. Audience: comparative political economists and political scientists. Tone: empirically rigorous, grounded in institutional economics, reproducible on public OWID data.
```

### [3] SKILL-INPUT — aii-python · 2026-06-22 11:01:29 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-python** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-python
description: Python coding standards for experiment and evaluation scripts. Covers environment setup, logging, error handling, and code structure.
---

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.12+
- **NEVER use `pip` or `.venv/bin/pip`** — they are not installed. Use `uv` for ALL package operations:
  ```bash
  uv venv .venv --python=3.12
  source .venv/bin/activate  # or: .venv/bin/python script.py
  uv pip install pandas loguru  # NOT: pip install
  ```
- Create `.toml` file with dependencies, create uv `.venv` and activate it
- NO inline dependencies (no `# /// script` headers)

## Logging

Use `loguru` for all logging. Add a file sink alongside stdout.

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()  # Remove default handler
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")
```

Rules:
- Log every major step (data loading, processing start/end, results)
- If applicable, log every LLM API call input and output
- Truncate long outputs in logs (add truncation logic for potentially large strings)
- Use `logger.error()` in except blocks (traceback auto-captured)

## Error Handling

- Wrap major operations in try/except blocks
- Use `@logger.catch(reraise=True)` decorator on main functions — without `reraise=True`, the script exits 0 even on uncaught exceptions, hiding failures from downstream consumers
- Use explicit exception types, not bare `except:`
- Never silently swallow exceptions — always log them

```python
@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    try:
        data = load_data(path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error("Data file not found")
        raise
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.error("Invalid JSON in data file")
        raise
```

## Code Structure

- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations: `Path("data/input.json").read_text()` not `open(...).read()`
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use keyword arguments for functions with more than 4 parameters
- No hardcoded paths — derive from script location or accept as arguments

## Script Pattern

Standard pattern for experiment/evaluation scripts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Brief description of what this script does."""

from loguru import logger
from pathlib import Path
import json
import sys

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")

@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    # Load data
    data_path = Path("full_data_out.json")
    logger.info(f"Loading data from {data_path}")
    data = json.loads(data_path.read_text())
    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(data['examples'])} examples")

    # Process
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(data["examples"]):
        try:
            result = process(example)
            results.append(result)
        except Exception:
            logger.error(f"Failed on example {i}")
            continue

    # Save output
    output = {"examples": results}
    Path("method_out.json").write_text(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    logger.info(f"Saved {len(results)} results")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

name: aii-owid-datasets
description: Search and load datasets from Our World in Data catalog using BM25 search. Returns actual table data (default limit 3) with metadata, preview, and mini dataset. Use for global statistics on energy, health, COVID-19, economics, environment, demographics.
---

## Contents

- Workflow (2-phase table discovery process)
- Scripts (Search, Download with full parameters)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: 2-Phase Table Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Tables
Find tables with metadata (title, description, variables)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py "renewable energy" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Download Table (if suitable)
Download the table after reviewing the search results
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py "grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"
```

---

## Scripts

### Search OWID tables (aii_owid_search_datasets.py)

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py "climate change" --limit 3
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: When running multiple searches, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --limit 3' ::: 'renewable energy' 'climate change' 'covid mortality'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 3 OWID tables for 'climate change':

[1] Climate Change Impacts
    Path: grapher/climate/2023-10-15/climate_impacts
    Description: Global temperature anomalies and sea level rise...
    Variables (42 total):
      - Global temperature anomaly (°C): Annual global mean temperature anomaly
      - Sea level rise (mm): Global mean sea level change
      - Atmospheric CO2 concentration (ppm): Monthly CO2 concentration at Mauna Loa
      - Arctic sea ice extent (million km²): Monthly Arctic sea ice extent
      ...
```

**Parameters:**

`query` (required, positional)
- Search query string
- Examples: `"covid"`, `"energy mix"`, `"climate change"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Number of search results to return (default: 3)
- Higher values = more results to choose from

**Tips:**
- Search is fast (uses pre-built BM25 index, no network required)
- Returns metadata only - no data is downloaded
- Use the `path` field from results to download specific tables
- BM25 search ranks by relevance across table titles, descriptions, and variable metadata
- Search returns tables from all channels (garden=highest quality, meadow=raw, backport=legacy, open_numbers=Gapminder)

---

### Download OWID table (aii_owid_download_datasets.py)

Download a table by path (from search results) and save to files.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py "grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"
```

**Parallel execution (multiple tables):**

IMPORTANT: When downloading multiple tables, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {}' ::: 'grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix' 'grapher/demography/2023-10-10/population' 'grapher/health/2023-08-01/life_expectancy'
```

**Example output:**
```
Downloaded OWID table: grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix

Dimensions: 15,420 rows x 12 columns
Columns: country, year, coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, biofuels...

Files saved:
  Mini (READ THIS for development/testing): /path/to/mini_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json
  Preview (DO NOT READ - for logging only): /path/to/preview_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json
  Full (DO NOT READ - for scripts only):    /path/to/full_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json

Sample data (first 3 rows):
  Row 1:
    country: Afghanistan
    year: 2000
    coal: 0.5
    ...
```

**Parameters:**

`path` (required, positional)
- Table path from search results
- Examples: `"grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"`, `"garden/demography/2023-10-10/population"`

**Output files (auto-saved to `temp/tables/`):**
1. **Mini**: `mini_{path}.json` - 3 full rows - **READ THIS** for development/testing
2. **Preview**: `preview_{path}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - for code you write to read
3. **Full**: `full_{path}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - for code you write to read

**Tips:**
- **Critical**: Only read the mini file directly with Read tool. Preview and full are input paths for code you write
- Use the `path` from search results to download specific tables
- Downloads directly from OWID catalog (network required)
- Files always saved to `temp/tables/` (path included in response)

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

name: aii-json
description: JSON validation and formatting toolkit. Validate JSON files against schemas for experiment pipelines, and generate full/mini/preview versions of JSON datasets. Use for validating pipeline outputs, checking schema compliance, or creating size-optimized JSON variants.
---

## Contents

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Hypothesis Selection & Evaluation:**

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

name: aii-parallel-computing
description: "CRITICAL PERFORMANCE SKILL. Maximize hardware utilization for compute-intensive tasks. Covers GPU acceleration, CPU parallelism, and async I/O. The difference between hours of failure and minutes of success. Use whenever writing ANY script that processes data, makes API calls, or does computation."
---

**ALWAYS parallelize. Sequential processing is unacceptable for any non-trivial workload.** A sequential script doing 1000 API calls takes hours and fails halfway. An async version finishes in minutes with proper error handling. ALWAYS ask: "Can this run in parallel?" — the answer is almost always yes.

Read aii-use-hardware skill first → get `NUM_CPUS`, `HAS_GPU`, `VRAM_GB`, `device`. Set `NUM_WORKERS` proportional to available CPU capacity — check `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` and scale accordingly (e.g. 30% used → use ~70% of cores).

## Decision Tree (follow strictly)

- **I/O-bound** (API calls, downloads, web, file reads) → `asyncio` + `aiohttp` with `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`. NEVER do sequential HTTP requests in a loop.
- **CPU-bound, vectorizable** → GPU available: PyTorch on device / No GPU: NumPy vectorized ops. NEVER loop over array elements in Python.
- **CPU-bound, independent items** → `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=NUM_WORKERS)`. NEVER process items one-by-one when they're independent.
- **Sequential** → only acceptable when items have data dependencies (each depends on the previous result).

## GPU Rules

- Use up to 90% of available VRAM — scale gradually (start small, increase after each successful run, keep 10% buffer)
- Move to device → compute → move back: `torch.tensor(data, device=device)` → `.cpu().numpy()`
- OOM fallback: catch `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` → `empty_cache()` → halve batch size → retry on GPU. Keep reducing until it fits. Stay on GPU.
- Batch large data: chunk it, `del batch` between iterations to free VRAM

## Parallelism Rules

- **CPU-bound**: `ProcessPoolExecutor` + `as_completed`, pre-allocate result list indexed by submission order
- **I/O-bound**: `asyncio` + `aiohttp`, `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`, single shared `ClientSession`, `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
- Always add `tenacity` retries for transient failures, always set timeouts on HTTP requests
- **CRITICAL — `ProcessPoolExecutor` start method**: Default `fork` deadlocks with loguru (and any threading library). ALWAYS pass `mp_context=multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` when constructing `ProcessPoolExecutor` in any script that uses loguru, threading, or async I/O. Example:
  ```python
  import multiprocessing as mp
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
  with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=N, mp_context=mp.get_context("spawn")) as pool:
      ...
  ```

### [7] SKILL-INPUT — aii-web-tools · 2026-06-22 11:03:29 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-web-tools** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

  3-letter codes. Missing data <30%. Exportable as JSON with full/mini/preview variants.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  PHASE 1: IDENTIFY POST-1990 DEMOCRATIZERS

  Step 1.1: Search OWID for V-Dem transition data
  - Queries: 'V-Dem transition', 'regime transition 1990', 'Freedom House transition'
  - Use V-Dem v2x_polyarchy to identify transitions (crossed 0.5 threshold in 1990-1999)
  - Verify countries remained sovereign through 2022

  Step 1.2: Expected country list
  - Eastern Europe/CIS: POL, CZE, SVK, HUN, EST, LVA, LTU, SVN, HRV, ROU, BGR, ALB, MKD, SRB, MNE, BIH, UKR, BLR, MDA, RUS, ARM, GEO, AZE, KAZ, KGZ, UZB, TKM, TJK
  - Latin America: PER, GTM, PRY, HTI
  - Africa: BEN, BWA, CPV, GHA, MWI, MLI, NAM, STP, SEN, ZAF, ZMB, MDG, MOZ, TZA
  - Asia: MNG, PHL, THA, IDN

  PHASE 2: COLLECT OWID VARIABLES

  Step 2.1: V-Dem Electoral Democracy Index
  - Search: 'V-Dem electoral democracy', 'v2x_polyarchy'
  - Expected path: garden/v-dem/... or grapher/v-dem/...
  - Fallback: V-Dem website (www.v-dem.net/data)

  Step 2.2: Gini Coefficient
  - Search: 'Gini coefficient', 'income inequality'
  - Sources: World Bank, SWIID
  - Prefer: After-tax Gini

  Step 2.3: Mean Years of Schooling
  - Search: 'mean years of schooling', 'schooling'
  - Sources: UNESCO, Barro-Lee

  Step 2.4: Social Protection Spending
  - Search: 'social protection spending', 'social expenditure'
  - Sources: ILO, OECD
  - Note: Limited coverage in developing countries

  Step 2.5: Control Variables
  - GDP per capita (World Bank)
  - Natural resource rents (World Bank)
  - Population (UN)
  - Ethnic fractionalization (Alesina/Fearon, may need external source)

  PHASE 3: DATA MERGING AND CLEANING

  Step 3.1: Merge on country-year key (ISO 3-letter codes)
  Step 3.2: Filter to post-1990 democratizers
  Step 3.3: Handle missing data (<10%: interpolate; 10-30%: multiple imputation; >30%: document)
  Step 3.4: Create derived variables (median indicators, region dummies, z-scores)

  PHASE 4: EXPORT AND VALIDATION

  Step 4.1: Export full/mini/preview JSON
  Step 4.2: Validate (N countries, variable ranges, correlations, interaction feasibility)
  Step 4.3: Document sources (data_dictionary.json)

  FALLBACKS: If OWID fails use HuggingFace or direct download. If social protection sparse use health/education expenditure. If democratizer list uncertain use V-Dem v2x_transition.

  TIME: 6 hours total (Phase 1: 1h, Phase 2: 2.5h, Phase 3: 1.5h, Phase 4: 1h)
  PARALLELIZATION: All OWID searches and downloads can run in parallel.

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-python, aii-long-running-tasks, aii-json, aii-file-size-limit, aii-use-hardware, aii-parallel-computing.
TODO 2. Read skill files for your data sources (see <available_data_sources>) and domain handbook if applicable (see <available_domain_handbooks>). Based on plan and context, decide which source(s) to use. Include everything specified in the artifact plan, but you may also collect additional relevant data beyond what's listed. Run 50 diverse searches across chosen source(s) — BROAD, GENERAL terms, not very specific. Parallelize where supported.
TODO 3. Identify the 25 most promising datasets. IMPORTANT: Only consider datasets under 300MB. Preview/inspect sample rows for each candidate. Parallelize previews.
TODO 4. Research each candidate BEFORE choosing which to download. For each, search the web (aii-web-tools skill): dataset name, papers citing it, original source/task, popularity. Red flags: no search results, no papers, anonymized features (F1, F2...), <100 downloads, no documentation. Green flags: papers using it, clear documentation, meaningful features, established benchmark. Also consider: will features/structure allow meaningful evaluation of the planned method?
TODO 5. Decide which to KEEP vs DISCARD. Look for: clear structure, relevant fields, quality examples matching requirements, confirmed provenance. Determine which 14 datasets have the most suitable data. Download and save to `temp/datasets/`. Parallelize downloads.
</todos>

Direction: Comparative Political Economy — Inequality and Democratic Resilience. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that traces how inequality, education, and democratic-quality co-evolve across post-1990 democratizers, identifies what sustains resilience versus backsliding, and tests whether welfare-state institutions mediate the link. MUST use Our World in Data (OWID) panels.

Ambition: level 1 of 5 — confirmatory/parametric science: a careful confirmatory test within established institutional-economics theory; precision, identification, and robustness over conceptual novelty.

Reviewer: I am Daron Acemoglu (MIT). Calibrate from my existing work. Cross-domain perspectives (historical sociology, political behavior, economic anthropology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for the American Political Science Review, the Journal of Democracy, or World Politics. Audience: comparative political economists and political scientists. Tone: empirically rigorous, grounded in institutional economics, reproducible on public OWID data.

<available_data_sources>
Use the sources appropriate to your task. Read the relevant skill file BEFORE using each source.

- **HuggingFace Hub** (HF) — ML datasets (NLP, vision, tabular, benchmarks)
- **Our World in Data** (OWID) — Global statistics (energy, health, economics, environment, demographics)
- **Alternate methods** — Python/shell (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URL, APIs, etc.)

If the plan specifies a source or one fits better, use it.
You may combine sources. Use web search (aii-web-tools skill) to research candidates (background, papers, provenance) — NOT to find/download datasets.
</available_data_sources>

<available_domain_handbooks>
If your domain has a handbook, read the relevant skill file BEFORE working on that domain.

- **Multi-LLM Agents** — dataset selection, evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns
</available_domain_handbooks>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.
</repo_upload_exclusions>

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. For the top 14 datasets, create data.py (uv inline script) that: loads from temp/datasets/, standardizes to exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill), extracts all examples per dataset, handles domain requirements, saves to full_data_out.json.

Each data ROW must be a separate example — do NOT create one example per dataset or per fold. Each data point (row, sample, instance) = one example. 500 rows → 500 examples. The output is GROUPED BY DATASET:
```json
{
  "datasets": [
    {
      "dataset": "iris",
      "examples": [
        {"input": "...", "output": "...", "metadata_fold": 2, "metadata_feature_names": [...]},
        ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "dataset": "adult_census",
      "examples": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```
Per-example required fields:
- `input`: input features/text (tabular: JSON string of feature values)
- `output`: target/label (as string)
Per-example optional metadata via `metadata_<name>` fields (flat, not nested object):
- `metadata_fold`: fold assignment (int), `metadata_feature_names`: feature name list, `metadata_task_type`: "classification"/"regression", `metadata_n_classes`: number of classes, `metadata_row_index`: original row index, etc.
Do NOT use `split`, `dataset`, or `context` as per-example fields. Dataset name goes at the group level, metadata goes in `metadata_*` fields.
TODO 2. Run 'uv run data.py' and fix errors. Validate full_data_out.json against exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill) — fix errors. Generate preview, mini, full versions with aii-json skill's format script.
TODO 3. Read preview to inspect examples. Choose THE BEST 7 DATASETS based on domain requirements and artifact objective. Be very attentive to meticulously and exhaustively fix any errors in your code.

title: OWID Panel Data Collection for Triple Shield Hypothesis
summary: >-
  Collect complete OWID panel data (1990-2022) for all variables required to test the triple interaction hypothesis (inequality
  × education × welfare) on democratic backsliding in post-1990 democratizers.
runpod_compute_profile: gpu
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  Panel dataset with country-year observations for post-1990 democratizers (1990-2022). Variables: (1) Outcome: V-Dem Electoral
  Democracy Index (0-1); (2) Predictor: Gini coefficient; (3) Moderator 1: Mean years of schooling; (4) Moderator 2: Social
  protection spending % GDP; (5) Controls: GDP per capita, natural resource rents, population. Country-year format with ISO
  3-letter codes. Missing data <30%. Exportable as JSON with full/mini/preview variants.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  PHASE 1: IDENTIFY POST-1990 DEMOCRATIZERS

  Step 1.1: Search OWID for V-Dem transition data
  - Queries: 'V-Dem transition', 'regime transition 1990', 'Freedom House transition'
  - Use V-Dem v2x_polyarchy to identify transitions (crossed 0.5 threshold in 1990-1999)
  - Verify countries remained sovereign through 2022

  Step 1.2: Expected country list
  - Eastern Europe/CIS: POL, CZE, SVK, HUN, EST, LVA, LTU, SVN, HRV, ROU, BGR, ALB, MKD, SRB, MNE, BIH, UKR, BLR, MDA, RUS, ARM, GEO, AZE, KAZ, KGZ, UZB, TKM, TJK
  - Latin America: PER, GTM, PRY, HTI
  - Africa: BEN, BWA, CPV, GHA, MWI, MLI, NAM, STP, SEN, ZAF, ZMB, MDG, MOZ, TZA
  - Asia: MNG, PHL, THA, IDN

  PHASE 2: COLLECT OWID VARIABLES

  Step 2.1: V-Dem Electoral Democracy Index
  - Search: 'V-Dem electoral democracy', 'v2x_polyarchy'
  - Expected path: garden/v-dem/... or grapher/v-dem/...
  - Fallback: V-Dem website (www.v-dem.net/data)

  Step 2.2: Gini Coefficient
  - Search: 'Gini coefficient', 'income inequality'
  - Sources: World Bank, SWIID
  - Prefer: After-tax Gini

  Step 2.3: Mean Years of Schooling
  - Search: 'mean years of schooling', 'schooling'
  - Sources: UNESCO, Barro-Lee

  Step 2.4: Social Protection Spending
  - Search: 'social protection spending', 'social expenditure'
  - Sources: ILO, OECD
  - Note: Limited coverage in developing countries

  Step 2.5: Control Variables
  - GDP per capita (World Bank)
  - Natural resource rents (World Bank)
  - Population (UN)
  - Ethnic fractionalization (Alesina/Fearon, may need external source)

  PHASE 3: DATA MERGING AND CLEANING

  Step 3.1: Merge on country-year key (ISO 3-letter codes)
  Step 3.2: Filter to post-1990 democratizers
  Step 3.3: Handle missing data (<10%: interpolate; 10-30%: multiple imputation; >30%: document)
  Step 3.4: Create derived variables (median indicators, region dummies, z-scores)

  PHASE 4: EXPORT AND VALIDATION

  Step 4.1: Export full/mini/preview JSON
  Step 4.2: Validate (N countries, variable ranges, correlations, interaction feasibility)
  Step 4.3: Document sources (data_dictionary.json)

  FALLBACKS: If OWID fails use HuggingFace or direct download. If social protection sparse use health/education expenditure. If democratizer list uncertain use V-Dem v2x_transition.

  TIME: 6 hours total (Phase 1: 1h, Phase 2: 2.5h, Phase 3: 1.5h, Phase 4: 1h)
  PARALLELIZATION: All OWID searches and downloads can run in parallel.

<todos>
TODO 1. Update data.py to only include the chosen 7 datasets and generate full_data_out.json. Re-run to generate full_data_out.json. Validate output format with aii-json skill and fix any errors. Generate full, mini, and preview versions with aii-json skill's format script using `--input full_data_out.json` (creates full_full_data_out.json, mini_full_data_out.json, preview_full_data_out.json — rename to full_data_out.json, mini_data_out.json, preview_data_out.json).
TODO 2. Verify full_data_out.json, preview_data_out.json, and mini_data_out.json exist in your workspace (see <workspace>) and contain correct data.
TODO 3. Apply aii-file-size-limit skill's file size check procedure (100MB limit) to full_data_out.json.
TODO 4. Ensure a `pyproject.toml` exists in your workspace with ALL dependencies pinned to the exact versions installed in your .venv (run `.venv/bin/pip freeze` to get them). This is required for reproducibility. The [project] section must include name, version, requires-python, and a dependencies list with pinned versions (e.g. `numpy==2.0.2`, not `numpy>=2.0`).
